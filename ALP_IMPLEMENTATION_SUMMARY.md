# ALP Card Balance Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Etherscan API V2 integration to fetch real-time ALP (ApolloX LP) token balance from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Etherscan API Service
**File**: `src/services/etherscanApi.ts`

- Implements Etherscan API V2 with multichain support
- Queries BNB Smart Chain (chainid: 56) for token balances
- Fetches ALP token balance from contract `0x4E47057f45adF24ba41375a175dA0357cB3480E5`
- Monitors wallet address `0x88902e56e83331379506A4313595f5B9075Ad3e0`
- Includes 60-second caching to minimize API calls
- Converts token balance from wei to readable format (18 decimals)
- Provides error handling and detailed logging

**Key Functions**:
- `getTokenBalance()` - Generic function to get any ERC-20 token balance
- `getALPBalance()` - Convenience function specifically for ALP token
- `clearCache()` - Manual cache invalidation if needed

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component
**File**: `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `etherscanAPI` service
- Created `alpBalance` state to store the fetched balance
- Implemented `fetchALPBalance()` function to retrieve balance from Etherscan
- Integrated balance fetching into initial data load (parallel with vault data)
- Added balance updates to the periodic refresh cycle (every 60 seconds)
- Replaced hardcoded value `1250.75` with dynamic `alpBalance` in ALPDisplay component
- Added error handling to gracefully handle API failures

### 3. Updated Environment Configuration
**File**: `env.example`

- Added `REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable documentation
- Users need to set this in their `.env` file with their Etherscan API key

## API Details

### Endpoint
```
https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api
```

### Parameters
- `chainid`: 56 (BNB Smart Chain)
- `module`: account
- `action`: tokenbalance
- `contractaddress`: 0x4E47057f45adF24ba41375a175dA0357cB3480E5 (ALP Token)
- `address`: 0x88902e56e83331379506A4313595f5B9075Ad3e0 (Wallet)
- `apikey`: User's Etherscan API key from environment variables

### Response Format
Returns the token balance in wei (smallest unit), which is then converted to readable format by dividing by 10^18.

## Environment Variable Setup

Users need to add the following to their `.env` file:
```
REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_actual_etherscan_api_key_here
```

**Note**: Etherscan API V2 supports multiple chains with a single API key.

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: 60-second cache reduces unnecessary API calls
2. **Parallel Fetching**: ALP balance is fetched in parallel with vault data on initial load
3. **Error Handling**: Failed API calls don't crash the app; previous balance is retained
4. **Timeout**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging requests

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Successful TypeScript compilation (no errors)
- Production build verification (no warnings)
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Cache mechanism validation

## How It Works

1. On dashboard load, the `fetchALPBalance()` function is called
2. The function queries Etherscan API V2 for the token balance on BSC
3. The response is converted from wei to readable format
4. The balance is cached for 60 seconds to minimize API calls
5. The balance is displayed in the ALPDisplay component
6. Every 60 seconds, the balance is automatically refreshed

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for the future:
- Add loading indicator for ALP balance while fetching
- Display last updated timestamp for the balance
- Add manual refresh button for ALP balance
- Support for multiple token balances
- Token price integration to show USD value

## Deployment Notes

Before deploying, ensure:
1. The `.env` file contains `REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`
2. The Etherscan API key is valid and has sufficient rate limits
3. The environment variable is properly set in the production environment (e.g., Netlify environment variables)

## API Rate Limits

Etherscan free tier allows:
- 5 calls per second
- 100,000 calls per day

With 60-second caching, the dashboard makes approximately:
- 1 call per minute per user
- ~1,440 calls per day per active user

This is well within the free tier limits for typical usage.
